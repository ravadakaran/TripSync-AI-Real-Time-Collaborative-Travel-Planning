Independent educational prototype, broader project title “Airbnb Real-Time AI Trip Planning & Collaboration Platform.” No Airbnb affiliation, account access or integration is implied. Source: [PRD](Document/Project%20Document.docx), v1.0 September 2026, especially §§4,8–15.

**Current status: Phases 1–4 implementation/evidence tasks are complete.** The shared board, local grounded Concierge, chat/presence, voting, exact budgets, conflicts, dashboard/recommendations, analytics and Admin ingestion have acceptance evidence. [Phase 4 evidence](docs/PHASE_4_EVIDENCE.md) records security/recovery/setup checks, final tests and measured limitations: strict maximum sync missed, cold inference falls back, and rendered-AI P95/50-planner capacity are unestablished. Frontend design checks remain in [frontend evidence](docs/FRONTEND_UI_EVIDENCE.md).

**Selected track: Track A (full-stack). Selected stack: Python — FastAPI native WebSockets, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy async/asyncpg, Pytest; React JavaScript client.** Exactly one application backend; Concierge/recommendations are local Python modules. The PRD permits hosted or local inference. The user selected local open-source inference: Qwen2.5 1.5B through a portable Ollama runtime; this is an implementation choice, not a PRD mandate. Concierge business logic belongs to the single Python application backend. Alternatives and trade-offs are in [decisions](docs/DECISIONS.md).

New trips default to **Bengaluru, INR (₹) and IST** and can select another destination with an active dataset. Goa is an additional fictional INR/IST sample. Prices and destination metadata are fictional project-authored samples. Existing trips retain their original currency. See [India localization evidence](docs/INDIA_LOCALIZATION_EVIDENCE.md).

## Intended scope

The final build includes a shared day-by-day activity/lodging board, invites and trip roles, Drafting/Voting/Locked lifecycle, version-checked edits, chat/typing/reactions, presence/reconnect, Leader moderation, exact budgets and contested votes. The Concierge filters authored metadata before ranking and RAG generation, cites sources, flags schedule/budget conflicts and handles no-match/model outages safely. Dashboard/history/preferences, hybrid content+collaborative recommendations, session analytics and Admin dataset upload complete the three epics (§6).

Private/local use by one operator, one engineer, four-week baseline. No booking, payments, live travel APIs, native app, public hosting/CDN or multi-tenant infrastructure. At least one fully authored destination covers all constraint types. Required functionality is not excluded as an “MVP.” The first vertical slice is only the first milestone.

## Start here

### Roles at a glance

- **Leader:** the trip's lead member, who manages invitations and room settings, moderates participants, and controls votes and finalization.
- **Member:** a participant in a trip, with a Viewer role for reading/chat/Concierge or a Planner role that also permits editing drafting items and voting, subject to Leader restrictions.
- **Admin:** an account with dataset-management privileges, which still needs trip membership and the appropriate trip role for room actions.

See [roles and journeys](docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md#roles-and-journeys) for the permission matrix and ADR-003 in the [decision log](docs/DECISIONS.md) for the account-versus-trip-role decision.

### Setup and project guides

1. Read [requirements](docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md) and [provisional decisions](docs/DECISIONS.md).
2. Follow the [four-week plan](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) and [25-task backlog](docs/TASKS.md).
3. The core demo follows **authentication → create Trip Room → second participant joins → shared board synchronization**. Add a catalog venue or a personal activity, then exercise votes, constraints and budgets.
4. Follow the [setup/run/test commands](docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md), including local-model startup and migrations through `0012_personal_activities`. Actual exercised versions/results are in [Phase 2 evidence](docs/PHASE_2_EVIDENCE.md); final clean-setup/submission results are in Phase 4 evidence.
5. During implementation use Pytest/HTTP/socket/browser tests from feature creation, then collect actual evidence using the [demo/submission path](docs/DEMO_AND_SUBMISSION.md). See the recorded checks and limitations in the implementation evidence.

Weeks: 1 foundation + thin slice; 2 board and Concierge; 3 voting/personalization/analytics/Admin; 4 hardening/measurements/demo. High risks are Week 3 breadth, local model P95 <3 s, synchronization timing, batched durability and synthetic recommendation evaluation. Reduce dataset/model complexity before correctness, security, tests or documentation. See the decision log for voting eligibility/ties, room locking, Leader absence, money/time defaults and crash-loss limits needing review.

[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) defines incremental workflow; [AGENTS](AGENTS.md) guides later coding agents. Targets and actual outcomes are recorded in Phase 4 evidence: sync <100 ms, non-AI P95 <200 ms, AI P95 <3 s, fan-out <500 ms, snapshot within 2 s, conflict within 1 s in ≥95%, exact budgets/analytics, valid suggestions over ≥20 tests and Precision@5≥0.6. Design for 50 planners and multiple rooms; transparently reported 5–10-client tests are acceptable (§14.1).

## Run the application

Follow [environment setup](docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) to install dependencies, configure a private `.env`, migrate a disposable PostgreSQL database and start the API and React client. The documented first-slice scenario covers two accounts, room creation and joining, a shared pin, and its committed watermark. [Implementation evidence](docs/PHASE_1_EVIDENCE.md) records the actual tests, limitations and remaining acceptance work.

The app is intended for local development. The historical first-slice evidence describes an earlier subset; use the Phase 3 and side quest evidence for feature coverage. Final security, performance, restore and submission results are recorded in Phase 4 evidence.

### Phase 3 implemented

Exact weighted budgets, durable conflicts/timed elections, dashboard/group recommendations, session analytics and Admin dataset staging/activation are available. [Phase 3 evidence](docs/PHASE_3_EVIDENCE.md) records actual database, browser, real-model and evaluation results. Current migration head: `0012_personal_activities`; retain one application worker. Use the Admin room button or `python -m app.cli train-recommendations --destination "Bengaluru, India"` to refresh a model after collecting likes/pins. Phase 4 hardening/evidence is complete, with measured misses and limitations recorded.

### Frontend workspace

The React/Vite room has itinerary/day navigation, budget/voting/conflict sections, Concierge, chat and traveler presence, with light/dark themes and locally bundled Inter. Admin accounts can stage immutable datasets and review an activation confirmation. Server-calculated money, role permissions, stale-version rejection and socket watermarks remain authoritative. See [design tokens](DESIGN.md) and [UI verification](docs/FRONTEND_UI_EVIDENCE.md).

The authenticated workspace now follows the user's supplied working HTML draft: persistent sidebar, compact top bar, trip overview and separate connected feature pages. Actual data replaces the draft's sample values; see the draft-alignment section in [frontend evidence](docs/FRONTEND_UI_EVIDENCE.md).

### Phase 4 implemented — 2026-11-02

Transport/security hardening, ten-socket/two-room measurements, actual PostgreSQL backup/restore, compact grounded model selection, clean dependency reproduction and submission tooling are complete. Final validation: **116 backend tests passed with real inference and PostgreSQL, 8 frontend tests passed, production build and Chrome walkthroughs passed**. See [Phase 4 evidence](docs/PHASE_4_EVIDENCE.md) and [retrospective](docs/RETROSPECTIVE.md).

Measured limitations remain: maximum socket sync 144 ms and one rendered move 133 ms exceed the strict 100-ms target. Warm real-model HTTP P95 is 1.60 s with 99/100 grounded responses; cold inference falls back. A single rendered AI observation was 3.20 s including automation overhead; rendered AI P95 and fifty-distinct-planner capacity are unestablished. These outcomes are recorded, not silently passed. Raw samples, generated contracts, test output and the local HTTP collection are under `evidence/` and `http/`.

Use ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md's Phase 4 commands to reproduce checks. `python scripts/scan-submission.py` scans current/reachable-history signatures with explicit limits; `python scripts/package-submission.py` creates an ignored `.local/tripsync-phase4-submission.zip` and an evidence manifest. No credentials, dumps, dependency directories or model runtime are included.


### Side quests and submission

Destination selection, a separate-trip shortcut and personal activities are implemented. Apply migration 0012 and import the fictional Goa sample to expose that destination. Personal activities carry a user-entered per-person cost and participate in schedule/budget checks. Venue ballots and Concierge anchors use catalog entries. Current checks and §12.1 readiness are recorded in [submission follow-up](docs/SUBMISSION_READINESS.md).
